This data is crucial to fight corruption and, more importantly, understand how the money is being used and what kind of results the policy has achieved.<br/>While some Regions haven’t released much more information than the name of the beneficiary and the total value of the project, more and more public authorities in Europe are taking current regulations as an opportunity to manage EU funds more transparently.<br/>Two years ago I <a href="Entries/2011/9/7_A_strategic_balance_for_open_government_data_publication.html">blogged about three different open data strategies</a> that public authorities were pursuing back in 2010.<br/>	1.	The first implied the release of high-quality data in machine-readable format<br/>	2.	The second was focused on data visualization and interactive search in order to include non-technically oriented citizens in open data re-use and understanding<br/>	3.	The third was about NOT being open. Little detail, little quality, lots of PDFs.<br/>New data collected in October 2012 on the availability and quality of open data on EU Cohesion Policy tell quite a different story.  From October 2010 to October 2012 the strategies have evolved, leaving room for more speculation about what kind of supply of policy data we can expect for the future. More precisely, data suggests that the two proactive strategies have become one. <br/>According to a nonlinear multivariate analysis of 8 indicators on the openness and transparency of 434 Operational Programmes in Europe, it is not easy to clearly distinguish a strategy based on re-usable formats and detailed information from a strategy focused on letting users browse through data and diagrams. <br/>For example, in 2010 a machine-readable format was associated with highly detailed financial data on project implementation or with proper metadata and projects’ description, while the presence of a map or of advanced search capabilities was likely where data were presented directly in a HTML page. Now the two formats are highly correlated. This implies that some national or regional portals - just like Italy’s national portal <a href="Entries/2012/7/25_OpenCoesione_-_here_it_comes_the_Wiki-Regional_Policy.html">OpenCoesione</a> - now let the users both download the data in bulk and surf through the data right on the website. <br/>Obviously, this is good news for researchers, data journalists and ordinary citizens. Data providers seem to be more aware that <a href="http://www.ctg.albany.edu/publications/journals/giq_2010_stewardship/giq_2010_stewardship.pdf">the usefulness and stewardship principles are complementary</a>.  Most public agencies, though, keep following the same strategy of NOT being open and offer data in PDF with little information.<br/>The variables showed in the two graphs below relate to:<br/>	•	the format (PDF, XLS or CSV, HTML)<br/>	•	the way the data is presented (GEO = maps &amp; graphs; RIC = search functions)<br/>	•	the datail of the content (CONT) and the financial data in particular (FIN).

The projects are worth € 33.4 billion in resources for development and, in the lagging regions, they represent the main source of new investment in times of financial downturn.  Now they are open to public scrutiny: information on costs, payments, private co-funding, schedules, names of the public and private institutions involved, locations, etc. are available on the web in order to enhance the debate on the destination and use of the funding.<br/>Italy’s Minister for Territorial Cohesion and renowned EU Policy expert <a href="http://www.coesioneterritoriale.gov.it/fabrizio-barca-">Fabrizio Barca</a> believes that the lack of transparency on how public money is spent is one of the main reasons for the slow pace characterizing current Structural Fund absorption in Italy.  This initiative is therefore unprecedented, especially if the context of Southern Italy is taken into consideration. Southern Italy is where most of the financial resources for development converge and it is often depicted as highly corrupted and (long before the crisis) economically paralyzed.  After decades of subsidies, the extent to which European Regional Policy and its Structural Funds are actually effective remains controversial.<br/>So the main purpose of <a href="http://opencoesione.gov.it/">OpenCoesione</a> is to disinfect EU and Italian cohesion policies with the aid of a little sunshine. And while doing so, to improve policy effectiveness through extended public participation and collaboration.<br/><br/>Stewardship vs. usefulness: a balanced approach<br/>From the very beginning, OpenCoesione initiative struggled to cover the different needs of its potential users by diversifying the offer. This is to <a href="http://luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2011/9/7_A_strategic_balance_for_open_government_data_publication.html">find the right balance</a> between the two principles of stewardship (data quality, accuracy, etc.) and usefulness (providing easy-to-use tools to access the data). <br/>Two main components of this initiative are now on the web [in Italian only, at least for now]:<br/>	1.	An <a href="http://www.dps.tesoro.it/opencoesione/ml.asp">Open Data section on the website of the Department for Cohesion</a>, with a set of fully-detailed data on the projects funded by EU Regional Policy during the 2007-13 programming period. Data is published in CSV format under Creative Commons BY-SA license. The new website also includes additional data and <a href="http://www.dps.tesoro.it/DPSeXplorer/ml_eng.asp">two data visualizations</a> [in English] on Italian regional budgets and other economic figures at sub-national level. There is also a page with any existing analysis and insight based on the data, to be expanded in the future as the data - hopefully - is going to be used for research purposes. A similar section is available on the website of the Inter-ministerial Committee for Economic Planning including open data on the development policies funded by the national accounts.    This big open data repository is aimed at offering high-quality, easy-to-access data to anyone interested and so <a href="http://www.ctg.albany.edu/publications/journals/giq_2010_stewardship">improving citizens’ trust in government as a good steward of their information</a>.<br/>	2.	A new, open source website <a href="http://opencoesione.gov.it/">OpenCoesione.gov.it</a>. The user can surf through geo-referenced images, project fiches, statistics and dynamic graphs.  The <a href="http://epsiplatform.eu/content/italian-development-spending-data-published-open-coesione">Italian open data community immediately welcomed the portal</a> highlighting its weaknesses, while the press, with <a href="http://tg24.sky.it/tg24/economia/2012/07/17/ministro_coesione_teritoriale_open_coesione_dati_aperti_progetti_finanziamenti.html">a few exceptions</a>, did not cover the news. The portal is an effort to include non-technically oriented citizens and to provide a first, ‘official’ interpretation of the data.  Obviously, anyone can use the open data to re-interpret the official message and come up with her own relevant analysis and ‘storytelling’.  Though, a first-hand interpretation can help the citizen understand the original purpose of the policy maker, and so get an inside view of objectives, rationales and policy design.  Now, basically, this is limited to providing (a) information on the policy, (b) contextual data (economic data or “output” data at the regional level, such as unemployment figures or the percentage of households with a broadband connection) and (c) a dual classification system composed of 13 themes (energy, education, research, etc.) and 6 types of intervention (grants, infrastructures, financial engineering instruments, etc.).<br/><br/>Data quality first<br/>In his first speech to the Parliament on December 2011 [<a href="http://commentmario.it/speech.php?sp=DIR/12/06">here</a> in the ‘commentable’ version provided by <a href="http://commentmario.it/">CommentMario.it</a>], Minister Barca described the data that his own Department has been managing for years as “extraordinary” in terms of its potential impact on public discourse. He called himself “lucky enough, since the data is ready and only needs to be opened up”. Correct, the data is indeed extraordinary given its high level of detail but, at that time, it was not ready at all.  <br/>As a policy analyst at the Department for Cohesion, I have been working with this kind of data for 5 years now. The national repository on EU Regional Policy is the main source of information for the insights and internal reports I make for my Director General. For this reason I have been involved in a process aimed at uncovering, cleaning up and making sense of a large amount of data including variables that were left unused – and so unknown.  For example, I soon realized that in my work I was using only a small part of this huge dataset. While I was focusing mainly on the financial aspects of the projects’ implementation, the dataset contained all kinds of information about the project lifecycle.  From January on, I can estimate that this process of cleaning up and consolidating the data involved 2-3 people full-time, all members of an internal working group led by Simona De Luca and Carlo Amati.  Actually, many more people have been involved in the group but not on a full-time basis, which is not an ideal situation from an organizational perspective. The group combines different professional specializations (public policy, statistics, IT, law, etc.).<br/>Two key issues soon emerged:<br/>	•	The dataset is a kind of “secondary source”. It collates data from at least 30 different information systems, which are used by the regional or national institutions for managing the funds and keeping track of the progress made by the projects, into one national repository. Even though metadata is the same, different interpretations of the same variable may occur, resulting in non-consistent or even conflicting information.  This can be considered a sort of a side effect of multi-level governance, which characterizes EU Regional Policy (see for example Panorama magazine’s  <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/newsroom/detail.cfm?LAN=EN&id=252&lang=en">last issue</a> on partnerships edited by the European Commission).  In some cases, inconsistencies and conflicts are still to be solved through accurate analysis involving interviews with regional authorities. These variables are therefore “frozen” for future publication.<br/>	•	Some of the data contains personal identifiers, i.e. names and surnames included in the title of the project. It has been decided to intervene to protect the identity of the people involved with special attention to socially disadvantaged categories. So the projects aimed, for example, at promoting social inclusion or combating discrimination have been anonymized before being published.   The projects that have been anonymized are the 10% of the total, and the 3% in terms of value.<br/><br/>The rise of the Wiki-Regional Policy: from transparency to control to crowdsourcing<br/>Opening the “black box” of Structural Funds is for sure a big step towards greater transparency.  Efficiency and effectiveness of regional policy would benefit greatly from improved transparency regarding  how, where and when public money is spent. However, in order to have real impact it is essential to enable bi-directional flows of information between government and civil society by promoting participation and collaboration from all kinds of stakeholders.<br/>The citizen and civil society in general can act as a powerful source both in terms of control of the spending and suggestions for further improvements in policy design and implementation.  In particular, public, dispersed control should focus on the results of the policy by comparing targeted and achieved outputs with final outcomes, as represented in the figure above.  This is expected to influence the decisions of policy makers with a positive effect on levels of fund absorption, the quality of public investments and citizens’ participation in public choices. <br/>Firstly, OpenCoesione needs the citizens because the description of the projects is sometimes incomplete or not fully comprehensible. As <a href="http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2012/07/23/opencoesione-dove-non-vanno-a-finire-i-finanziamenti-pubblici/302518/">highlighted by the Italian blogger Guido Scorza</a>, current descriptions  lack key information of projects’ rationales, objectives and genesis. Also, it is difficult to understand the broader policy objective behind it or what strategy was followed by the regional authority to justify this action.  Information on regional strategies and objectives, as well as on the types of interventions involving one or more specific projects, is already in possess of the administrations. Here a more efficient coordination and better integration between the national and the regional information systems is needed.<br/>However, detailed information about each project is sometimes simply not available. So, on the OpenCoesione portal, each of the 450,000 pages describing the projects includes a <a href="http://opencoesione.gov.it/progetti/segnalazione/?cup=J57H09000720006">form</a> that can be used to provide additional information about the project itself. A mechanism similar to that of Wikipedia. As <a href="http://cairns.typepad.com/">Beth Noveck</a> points out in her book <a href="http://www.wiki-government.com/">Wiki Government</a>, “when a policy problem is divided into smaller parts, so that it can be distributed and worked on by collaborative teams, the drive toward openness and innovation begin”.<br/>Secondly, the citizen can provide feedback on project implementation, as well as information on perceived results. Examples of the questions included in the form are: “What did the project achieve?”, “What are the main results?”, “What is the impact on your city or region?”, “How can the project be improved?”.   Within each thematic area of the website (research, energy, etc.), information on the projects funded can be compared with relevant statistics at the regional level, in order to highlight current levels of performance and related trends.<br/>All the information gathered from the users (common citizens living nearby, experts, project managers, civil servants or researchers, etc.) on the projects’ achievements is going to be used to enrich current datasets, even if it is too early to determine exactly what this integration will look like. The intention here is to transfer the feedback on both data quality and the project results  from central government to the responsible regional institutions in order to enable quick action.  A permanent “technical group” has also been established with representatives of both national and regional institutions to strengthen the links between the two tiers of government and exchange additional information about the projects. For example, the Ministry of Research is ready to offer its data on research and innovation projects already published as open data on the <a href="http://www.ponrec.it/">website of the Programme “Research and Competitiveness”</a>. <br/><br/>Built to last? The efforts of a government of technocrats<br/>Such a big effort challenges well-established tacit norms and procedures in the management of development policies. In Italy, these “tacit norms” date back to the 50’s (see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassa_per_il_Mezzogiorno">beginning of cohesion policy</a> in Italy) and often consider the EU requirement for transparency a question of mere formal compliance. OpenCoesione anticipates the <a href="http://luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2011/10/6_Structural_Funds_2014-2020_open_up_to_open_data.html">future rules of 2014-2020 EU programming</a> period and goes even further to encourage feedback and collaboration form all stakeholders.  This is even more surprising considering that national policies, traditionally far less transparent than EU policies, are also being opened as part of the same operation.  So, why now? <br/>The Italian open data movement is quite proud of its <a href="http://luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2010/11/4_Open_data_italy__the_bottom-up_approach.html">bottom-up approach</a>, a peculiar way to “innovate without permission”. However, in this case, it would have been impossible to open up such a huge dataset without the right, top-down push. If your data is stored in a vault, there is no way to get it back.<br/>According to Simona De Luca, “in a time of severe economic austerity, Italy’s ‘technical government’ has increased [rather than reduced] emphasis on the publication of open data as a means to help boost the economy and make government more efficient” (see her talk at “<a href="http://www.w3.org/2012/06/pmod/">Using Open Data</a>” W3C/Crossover workshop).   <a href="http://www.cottica.net/">Alberto Cottica</a>, one of the chairs of the workshop, <a href="https://twitter.com/alberto_cottica/status/215093126593921025">commented on Twitter</a> “Transparency provides legitimacy, and a technocratic government needs that a lot.”.  <br/>In any case, it is evident that this technocratic government is not going to last.  In April 2013 (at the latest), elections will pave the way for a new, political government. This is why, in my opinion, such a government is less afraid of the consequences of exposing relevant data, which might be used to prove political failures. <br/>At the presentation event for OpenCoesione Minister Barca invited all stakeholders to use and re-use the data. Only if this initiative manages to reach a ‘critical mass’ in terms of usage will it have the chance not to be shut down in 2013.  Researchers, journalists, socio-economic partnerships and associations leaders, local public administrators, as well as government and opposition representatives are called for action.  As always, big challenges lie ahead.<br/>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:146:"http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2012/7/25_OpenCoesione_-_here_it_comes_the_Wiki-Regional_Policy_files/droppedImage_1.png";s:6:"length";s:6:"156260";s:4:"type";s:9:"image/png";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:47:"

Many analysts and researchers consider composite indicators as “black boxes” (see for example <a href="http://ras.sagepub.com/content/73/2/171.short">this paper by Frank Bannister</a>, 2007). We put in still intelligible indicators and what comes out is a mysterious number, and, inevitably, a mysterious rank.  The feeling is that it’s a weird combination of <a href="http://www.mendeley.com/research/ratings-rankings-voodoo-science-1/">voodoo</a> (or too complicated math), subjectivity, weak frameworks, unbelievable results (can you really believe that Italy has put <a href="http://www.epractice.eu/en/library/5283331">100% of public services on line</a> with the highest possible level of interactivity?).<br/>A 3-days seminar at the JRC-IPSC of the European Commission opened my mind. There I found a motivated and <a href="http://composite-indicators.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">high-skilled team coordinated by Andrea Saltelli</a>, which, by the way, was responsible for drafting the <a href="http://www.oecdbookshop.org/oecd/display.asp?CID=&LANG=en&SF1=DI&ST1=5KZN79PVDJ5J">OECD-EC Handbook on Constructing Composite Indicators</a>.<br/>While it was clear to me that things like data quality, framework reliability and transparency - when it comes to show how the results have been computed - are always crucial, I learned that composite indicators quality and robustness can and must be checked, and that more advanced and reliable techniques can be applied. I suspect that if we applied tools such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_analysis">Sensitivity Analysis</a> or the Uncertainty Analysis to the existing “black box” indicators we would get an idea of how ranks can vary and of therefore at what extent resulting policy indications can be week. <br/>I’ve been working for quite some time on a composite indicator on eServices (eGovernment, eEducation, eTransportation, to be extended to eHealth and Smart Cities) for <a href="http://www.econ.uniurb.it/eib_project/">research project TAIPS</a> funded by the European Investment Bank, together with my friends and colleagues Marco Biagetti, Davide Arduini and Professor Antonello Zanfei.  I presented some preliminary results at the <a href="http://www.econ.uniurb.it/Eiburs-TAIPS_Conference_2012/">1st EIBURS-TAIPS Conference</a> at Urbino University (here you can find <a href="http://www.econ.uniurb.it/Eiburs-TAIPS_Conference_2012/program.htm">all papers and slides</a> from the conference), in front of a bunch of innovation policy gurus including Paul David, Ian Miles, Edward Steinmueller and Keith Smith.<br/>Here is the abstract and my slides. Enjoy!<br/><br/><br/>Abstract<br/>The study aims at providing evidence on regional differences in the diffusion of ICT in the public sector in Italy, with a focus on different types of public e-services (eGovernment, eEducation and Intelligent Transport Systems). Data are obtained by merging four different surveys carried out by Between Co. (2010-11) and Istat - Italy’s National Bureau of Statistics (2009). We pursue a three-fold objective. First, we attempt to overcome the prevailing attitude to consider the various domains of public e-service provision as separate from one another. In other words, measuring the progress of digital government requires a holistic view to capture the wide spectrum of public e-services in different domains (e.g. local and national administrative procedures, transportation, education, etc.) and the different aspects of service provision (not just e-readiness or web interactivity, but also multi-channel availability and take-up). Second, we shall tackle a major drawback of existing statistics and benchmarking studies of public e-services, which are largely based on the count of services provided online, by including more sophisticated indicators both on quality of services offered and back office changes. Third, we develop a sound, open and transparent methodology for constructing a public eServices composite indicator based on OECD/EC-JRC Handbook. This methodology, which incorporates experts opinion into a Data Envelopment Analysis, will allow us to combine data on different e-service categories and on different aspects of their development, and will enable us to define a ranking of Italian regions in terms of ICT adoption and public e-service development.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:149:"http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2012/4/26_Why_we_need_another_composite_index_%28on_public_e-Services%29_files/Untitled.jpg";s:6:"length";s:5:"84447";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:47:"

But the way they do this varies greatly across Europe.<br/>The second output of the <a href="http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2011/3/18_Towards_EU_Benchmarking_2.0_-_Transparency_and_Open_Data_on_Structural_Funds_in_Europe.html">evaluation activity of the availability and quality of open data on European Structural Funds</a> is now being published.  It’s a <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/71030752/La-Trasparenza-Dei-Fondi-Strutturali-2011">benchmarking report</a> (in Italian only, at least for now) that I prepared with the help of my colleague Chiara Ricci for the DG Regional Policy of the Italian Ministry of Economic Development.<br/>I had the chance to present it at the <a href="http://porfesr.lazio.it/PORFESR/news/news_0141.html">Annual Meeting between the European Commission and the Italian Managing Authorities</a> of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), held on October 27-28, 2011 in Rome. It was an extraordinary opportunity to talk about the benefits of open government data in front of a number of high-level representatives of all regional and central institutions involved in the implementation of Regional Policy in Italy (here is <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rejus/i-beneficiari-finali-dei-fondi-strutturali-la-trasparenza-della-politica-regionale-europea">my presentation</a>).<br/>The report features brand new data on detail, accessibility, formats, and other characteristics of the datasets on the recipients and the projects funded by European Regional Policy (“lists of beneficiaries”). It’s a new wave of data collected in October 2011, exactly one year after the first web-based survey. A total of 32 characteristics are taken into account in the evaluation process, including the presence of search masks and visualization systems.  <br/>The map of Structural Funds transparency reported below shows a core component of this research, that is the format of the data published by each region.  The map shows the average score of all the regional and multi-regional programmes that have an impact of that specific territory.  A very low score is attributed to PDFs and to HTML reports that split the data into multiple tables or pages (regions in red or orange) . Higher scores are assigned to the XLS format, which is machine-processable (in yellow). The highest scores are attributed to the few regions in Europe that publish data in an open format such as CSV (in green), since no data is currently published in XML or JSON or RDF (see the report for the details about the construction of the index).   You can also find the link to the datasets by clicking on each region. The link to the Regional Programme is displayed where there is more than one dataset available.<br/>One year after the first survey, the level of openness has not improved. About two-thirds of EU Operational Programmes still publish their data in PDF, while only 2% use open formats.

Although these drafts need to be definitively adopted by the end of 2012 by the Council and the European Parliament, this step is going to represent a milestone in a long process. On the one hand, it is the final product of a two-years-long discussion started in the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/what/future/hlg_documents_en.cfm">high-level group reflecting on future Cohesion Policy</a>, a support working group composed by representatives of the Commission and the Member States. On the other hand, it represents the beginning of the 2014-2020 programming phase.<br/>A new principle is introduced. Regional Policy will not finance a Member State Programme until a set of ex-ante conditionalities, that is specific conditions and pre-requisites at the national level, are fulfilled. Ex-ante conditionalities were first envisioned by the European Commission in the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/articles/euro/documents/com_2010_367_en.pdf">framework of the debate on the reinforcement of economic governance [pdf]</a>. Then they were reaffirmed in the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/cohesion_report/">Fifth Cohesion Report</a> and further developed in a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/what/future/pdf/hlg/hlg7_2010_12_02_conditionality_nonpaper.pdf">high level group document [pdf]</a> proposed by the Commission in December 2010.<br/>A list of the conditionalities proposed can be found in the general regulation. As for research and innovation (R&amp;I), the conditionality is as follows: “the existence of a national and/or regional innovation strategy for smart specialisation in line with the National Reform Program, to leverage private R&amp;I expenditure, which complies with the features of well-performing national or regional research and innovation systems”. <br/>The focus of the conditionality is in fact only on the strategic level, that is on the existence of policy documents that, based on tools such as the technological forecasting, select a limited number of policy priorities and industry sectors to support.  In particular, the proposal of the EU Commission states that Member States must:<br/>	•	define an innovation strategy for smart specialisation that is based on a SWOT analysis to concentrate resources on a limited set of R&amp;I priorities, outlines measures to stimulate private RTD investment and contains a monitoring and review system.<br/>	•	adopt a framework outlining available budgetary resources for R&amp;D;<br/>	•	adopt a multi-annual plan for budgeting and prioritization of investments linked to EU priorities (ESFRI).<br/>The need for a strategic view of regional policies in general and of innovation policies in particular (see for example the <a href="http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2010/8/7_Co-designing_regional_innovation_policies__a_new_project_for_multi-level%2C_bottom-up_coordination.html">much-needed smart specialization approach</a>) is evident. But is such a strategy-focused approach enough to ensure a better policy and a better use of public money? <br/>First, given the essential nature of R&amp;I policy, the answer should be “no”. As stated in <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/policy/future/pdf/3_bonnacorsi_final-formatted.pdf">one the underlying papers of the Barca Report on the future of Cohesion Policy</a>, “Putting money into a strategic R&amp;D plan may not always lead to a new technology, or even less to the adoption of that technology”.  In other words, identifying regional strengths and comparative advantages is correct, but will may not lead to the desired results.<br/>Secondly, a strategic document that is compliant with the Commission’s requests is easy to be obtained for a regional government. For example, the regional strategy could be written by a consultancy and adopted without an active involvement of regional and local agencies, and, even worse, of stakeholders. I don’t mean that this is the usual way to define a regional strategy, but it happens.<br/>Thirdly, a strategy defines policy objectives, priorities, targets, indicators, but does not describe exhaustively how these objectives are going to be reached. And we know that devil is in the details. <br/>So this is why other kinds of ex-ante conditionalities should be taken into account, specifically those related to policy implementation.  For example, one conditionality could focus on the specific content and characteristics of the criteria for projects selection included in the Operational Programmes.  Since Operational Programmes are generally set up after the definition of the “contract” between the Member State and the European Union, this solution may be more difficult to implement - because Member States should first approve the Operational Programmes and the selection criteria and than wait for the EU money - but will ensure a tremendous improvement in the quality of selected interventions. <br/>For example, a conditionality could be applied to the selection criteria by making sure they incorporate the results of ex-post evaluation of past interventions and learning from policy failures.  The conditionality could also be leveraged to systematically introduce a multi-stage approach in funding projects.

Earlier today Commissioners <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/hahn/index_en.cfm">Hahn</a> and <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/andor/index_en.htm">Andor</a> <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/1159&format=HTML&aged=0&language=EN&guiLanguage=en">presented the European Commission proposals</a> for the new Structural Funds regulations for the period 2014-2020. The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/what/future/proposals_2014_2020_en.cfm#1">new general regulation</a> includes an article that force EU countries and regions to open up their data on projects and beneficiaries of Regional Policy.  EU Regional Policy (or Cohesion Policy) <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/budget/reform/">is worth € 376 billion</a>, more than a third of the entire budget of the Union.<br/>In the last few months, technical and policy recommendations on how to improve the rules of this policy concerning transparency were provided by two studies (one <a href="http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2010/9/9_Open_data_On_Structural_Funds_at_the_european_parliament_-_the_long_way_towards_transparency.html">commissioned by the European Parliament</a> and <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/country/commu/pdf/final_report_erdf_en.pdf">the other by the DG Regional Policy</a> [pdf]) and one <a href="http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2011/3/18_Towards_EU_Benchmarking_2.0_-_Transparency_and_Open_Data_on_Structural_Funds_in_Europe.html">independent web-based survey</a>. Plus, organizations such as <a href="http://blog.transparency.org/?s=structural+funds">Transparency International advocated better rules and practices</a>, such as the creation of a centralized website that contains all EU funds beneficiaries and that publishes the data respecting the <a href="http://www.opengovdata.org/home/8principles">8 principles of Open Government Data</a>.  <br/>The good news is that most of these recommendations have been incorporated in the drafts of the new regulations. In particular, Art. 105 (Chapter II, Information and Communication) states that EU countries “shall in order to ensure transparency in the support of the Funds maintain a list of operations by operational programme and by Fund in CSV or XML format which shall be accessible through the single website or the single website portal providing a list and summary of all operational programmes in that Member State”.   <a href="http://www.epractice.eu/en/document/5290093">It has been demostrated</a> that the presence of a single website covering all data from the local institutions will likely improve the performance of the country in terms of transparency.<br/>The <a href="http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2010/3/2_Open_data_and_structural_funds.html">minimum set of information</a> to be provided - currently limited to three items - has been extended to cover new interesting data such as postcodes of beneficiaries. The data fields that must be included are listed in Annex V:<br/>	•	Beneficiary name (only legal entities; no natural persons shall be named);<br/>	•	Operation name;<br/>	•	Operation summary;<br/>	•	Operation start date;<br/>	•	Operation end date (expected date for physical completion or full implementation of the operation);<br/>	•	Total eligible expenditure allocated to the operation;<br/>	•	EU co-financing rate (as per priority axis);<br/>	•	Operation postcode;<br/>	•	Country;<br/>	•	Name of category of intervention for the operation;<br/>	•	Date of last update of the list of operations.<br/>	•	The headings of the data fields and the names of the operations shall be also provided in at least one other official language of the European Union.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this proposal is probably a good compromise between the need to introduce new, more transparent ways to publish data and the current level of technical and administrative capacity of EU regions. However, a few important features characterizing real open data are still missing. For example the data should be released in a linked-data formats such as the RDF. Plus, a clear indication of the license under which the data are released should be provided. Introducing these features now - even though the RDF format seems now pretty advanced - is particularly important seeing that it is rather difficult to modify a multi-annual regulation once it is approved.<br/>Obviously it will be crucial to monitor the actual implementation of these rules across the European Union. Luckily, official regulations have demonstrated to be a powerful tool, far more persuasive than other initiatives, such as the <a href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/institutional_affairs/decisionmaking_process/ai0003_en.htm">European Transparency Initiative</a>, undertaken by the Commission after the approval of the official regulations.  As already demonstrated, the level of compliance with regulations among EU agencies is extremely high, given that the Commission has the power to stop the flow of money from the EU to the Regions if these rules are broken.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:130:"http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2011/10/6_Structural_Funds_2014-2020_open_up_to_open_data_files/hahn.jpg";s:6:"length";s:6:"100552";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:47:"

My point there was that low take-up of public e-services, which is considered by some the main reason of the digital government failure, was probably simply due to a shortage of... public e-services. <br/>While most critics of EU e-government policy point only to the lack of interest of households and enterprises in expensive and unsustainable digital public services, I think we should also consider that today a significant number of public agencies, especially in the lagging regions of the world - fail to deliver their most useful basic public services on line. Considering e-government services, though most of them were pushed by national governments in the first years of the new millennium and are already available on the web with an acceptable level of sophistication (see for example the list of CapGemini twenty basic public services in <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/item-detail-dae.cfm?item_id=6537">latest benchmarking report</a>), the situation is very different at the local level, where small agencies are struggling to provide services with less money and face complex coordination issues with scarce skills.  <br/>Moreover, if we zoom out and consider advanced services from other recently-developed domains of digital government such as e-health, e-procurement, e-education, infomobility, “smart” cities, etc, the supply-related issues are manifest.<br/>In other words, measuring the progress of digital government requires a holistic view to include the wide spectrum of public e-services in different policy domains (health, transportation, education, etc.) and the different aspects of service provision (not just e-readiness or web interactivity, but also multi-channel availability and take-up).<br/>Providing this view is the main goal of <a href="http://www.econ.uniurb.it/eib_project/">TAIPS</a> (Technology Adoption and Innovation In Public Services), a research project carried out by the <a href="http://www.econ.uniurb.it/index_uk.asp?HOME">Department of Economics, Society and Politics</a> (DESP), University of Urbino (Italy) and funded by the <a href="http://www.eib.org/">European Investment Bank</a> (EIB), which aims at exploring the determinants and impact of public e-services diffusion from the point of view of the Economics of Innovation.  The project is lead by <a href="http://www.econ.uniurb.it/zanfei/zanfeiweb.htm">Professor Antonello Zanfei</a>, an industrial economist whose interests range from innovation diffusion to industrial dynamics and economics of multinational enterprises.<br/>A few weeks ago the first outputs were released. One paper is entitled <a href="http://www.econ.uniurb.it/eib_project/WP_a%201.1_What%20do%20we%20know%20from%20the%20literature%20on%20public%20e-services.pdf">What do we know from the literature on public e-services?</a> and provides quantitative evidence that ICT research, as it happens in policy making, still considers the various policy domains as separate silos. The next step of TAIPS will be to unify those views. A benchmarking the progress of Italian regions with a joint, e-services pilot methodology is under way. This exercise is to be eventually extended to selected EU Countries.<br/>Plus, TAIPS staff is organizing an International Conference in Urbino, Italy on April 19-20, 2012. Here you can <a href="Entries/2011/10/2_A_holistic_view_for_Public_e-Services_diffusion_and_impact__Introducing_project_T.A.I.P.S._files/TAIPS-EIBURS_Urbino_conference_outline_rev12-9-11-1.pdf">download the outline</a>. The deadline for abstract submission is pretty soon (on Wednesday, October 5), but will probably be extended a little bit. The conference will be interesting since many invited speakers - leading scholars in the field of Economics of Innovation and Information Technology - have already confirmed their participation.  I will report again on this in the next few weeks, so please stay tuned!<br/><br/>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:179:"http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2011/10/2_A_holistic_view_for_Public_e-Services_diffusion_and_impact__Introducing_project_T.A.I.P.S._files/e-services.jpg";s:6:"length";s:5:"86108";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:47:"

Access to information on the use of public money is crucial to ensure an effective participation, and to generate trust, credibility of public choices - even in hard times - and the effectiveness of the interventions.<br/>It’s interesting to compare two composite indicators on openness and transparency of public funding in Europe:<br/>	-	the <a href="http://internationalbudget.org/what-we-do/open-budget-survey/">Open Budget index</a> (OBI), released by the <a href="http://www.internationalbudget.org/">International Budget Partnership</a> (IBP) every year, analyzes budget transparency in 94 countries all around the world (here is the <a href="http://internationalbudget.org/files/2010_Full_Report-English.pdf">full report 2010</a>).  The index is composed by two pillars (“Availability of Budget Documents” and “Executive’s Budget Proposal”) and 92 qualitative variables that are aggregated by using a simple mean. The <a href="http://internationalbudget.org/what-we-do/open-budget-survey/research-resources/data/">data</a> are collected through a questionnaire by a network of independent organizations.<br/>	-	the index of transparency of EU Regional Policy (Structural Funds) that I put forward in <a href="http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2011/3/18_Towards_EU_Benchmarking_2.0_-_Transparency_and_Open_Data_on_Structural_Funds_in_Europe.html">this paper</a> published in the last issue of the European Journal of ePractice. It measures the openness and transparency of the data on the beneficiaries of the European funds that all regions and member states acting as Managing Authority of the policy must publish on the web. The evaluation is based on the <a href="http://www.opengovdata.org/home/8principles">Eight principles of Open Government Data</a><br/>While the Structural Funds transparency index is calculated for all Europe, the OBI index is available for only 14 European countries, which include almost all main member states.<br/>The first thing to note is that there is no correlation between the two indicators, at all. The best-performing countries in one index are the worst-performing countries in the other. France is maybe an exception, with very good results in open budget and a quite good score in Structural Funds transparency (mainly due to a centralized platform that provides information about all beneficiaries of regional programmes across the country). This non-correlation can be explained by taking into consideration the different phenomena that the two indicators aim to describe. OBI methodology mainly focuses on quantity and detail of information disclosed, while the index on transparency of EU policy mainly considers the quality and the format of the data.<br/>Secondly, at least two groups of countries seem to emerge. A first group (in green) is located at the top left of the graph and includes UK, France and Sweden. All the other countries (in red) show lower values of OBI index and quite similar values of the Structural Funds indicator, with the exception of Czech Republic and Slovakia that got very high scores. While the green group has a pretty long tradition of being open and accountable, the very good performances of the newcomers Eastern Europe countries are probably due to the positive role that the European Commission is playing in that region to push transparency of the programmes funded by EU policies.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:135:"http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2011/9/26_Open_Budget_and_Open_Data_on_Public_Policies_files/droppedImage.png";s:6:"length";s:5:"45852";s:4:"type";s:9:"image/png";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:47:"

The need to involve businesses in the open data movement emerged quite clearly at the first European <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/digital-agenda/daa/index_en.htm">Digital Agenda Assembly</a>, held in Brussels on 16-17 June 2011. In particular, the European Commission aims at stimulating more private participation in the open data initiatives, and is considering specific actions to promote the re-use of big datasets held by large private sector organizations.<br/><a href="http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/nrs/">Professor Nigel Shadbolt</a>, a member of the UK Government’s <a href="http://data.gov.uk/blog/new-public-sector-transparency-board-and-public-data-transparency-principles">Public Sector Transparency Board</a>, outlines the benefits of an open data strategy in an <a href="http://thinkquarterly.co.uk/01-data/open-for-business/">article published in Think Quarterly</a>.  “Open data offers the prospect of instant connectivity between partners, as in open supply chains, where businesses source from places they might never have considered or even suspected could be a source. Open data can reduce integration costs, improve transparency and harness the innovation of others. If you release your data then others will develop applications that make best use of it – providing new services that benefit you directly, like all of those free travel apps that the travel companies didn’t have to write, but which nevertheless drive people onto the transportation network”.<br/>Following the <a href="http://blog.simplegeo.com/2011/04/20/open-places-data/">example of other companies such as SimpleGEO</a> from the US, Enel - Italy’s largest power company and a key player in the European market - is <a href="http://data.enel.com/en">now opening up a first set of datasets</a>.  The company, which originally launched an open data portal on 23 August under Creative Commons BY NC ND license disallowing commercial re-use, earlier today <a href="http://www.epsiplatform.eu/news/news/enel_adapts_license_to_true_open_data">changed the license to a CC BY</a>, merely requiring re-users to mention Enel as the source of data. Datasets include economic and financial information about the company and “sustainability data”, which comprise data on generation, distribution and sale of electricity and gas.<br/>Raffaele Cirullo, head of New Media unit at Enel, reports on Enel strategies to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/spaghettiopendata">Spaghetti Open Data (SOD) mailing list</a>.  As a first step, an initiative entitled <a href="http://enelsharing.enel.com/">Enel Sharing</a> was launched in 2008 to harness the power of social media to promote the brand amongst stakeholders and disseminate the cultural initiatives of the company.  Then the unit focused on emerging innovations in the field of new media as a way to introduce a new culture of sharing within the group. Open data is of course one of the most interesting paradigm shifts, with major marketing impact within the private sector. These are <a href="http://data.enel.com/en/open-data/open-data">the main goals of Enel Open Data initiative</a>:<br/>	1.	improve the market by fostering competition<br/>	2.	increase transparency by increasing participation<br/>	3.	favor technological innovation by encouraging the development and spreading of new applications, mash-ups and data visualization systems.<br/>Personally, I very much share the opinion of <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/lorenzobenussi">Lorenzo Benussi</a> - researcher at <a href="http://nexa.polito.it/">NEXA Center for Internet &amp; Society</a> of Politecnico di Torino - who jumped in the discussion with a message to the SOD mailing list on the eventual advantages of the diffusion of the open data model in the private sector.  First, open financial data on corporate accounting may lead to a more effective control of global markets. Secondly, information on businesses assets, processes and activities is of great interest to the public and can be mashed-up with governmental data on the matter.

This is the message displayed on the webpages of <a href="http://www.lineaamica.gov.it/">RubricaPA</a>, a specific service that allows users to find and locate a public agency by searching among thousands of national, regional and local authorities.  The service is now letting the users modify the underlying data by submitting more accurate or updated information on an agency location, telephone number or certified email.<br/>The process is simple. You modify of a set of data through a form, then your suggestion is evaluated by the staff, and, if accepted... you have now adopted that specific data.  This means that the staff at the ministry considers yourself somehow responsible of that data and its change over time.  Something that may (or may not) create a sort of a personal bond with the data itself. Or even an <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/haiku66/crowdsourcing-govenrment-kublai-a-social-network-of-creatives-or-regional-development-presentation">act of love</a>, quoting from <a href="http://www.cottica.net/">Alberto Cottica</a>’s definition of social network.<br/>RubricaPA started to <a href="http://www.lineaamica.gov.it/rubricapa/opendata.php">publish open data</a> on public agencies addresses, fiscal codes and certified emails in October 2010 under the <a href="http://www.formez.it/iodl/">Italian Open Data License v1.0</a> (which is built on <a href="http://www.opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">Open Data Commons</a> and <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons BY-SA</a>), a step forward of national government towards open data.  But the dataset, created through a matching of data from different sources (official statistics, central registers, old similar projects), is flawed by data quality issues and missing values. Some information is outdated or inaccurate, sometimes conflicting.  That is why a little help from the crowd may become crucial. In fact, this is the first time that a central and official service sponsored by the <a href="http://www.innovazionepa.gov.it/">Ministry of Public Administration</a> resorts to crowdsourcing techniques to face major data quality issues.  <br/>The question is: who should be interested in helping “Linea Amica” improve its information services? The promoters hope to actively involve local public servants and citizens who care about their local community and want a major state-wide service such as Linea Amica help line to use the correct information.   “This is my data, I should care”.<br/>We will see if this kind of love is enough to get the right level of participation.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:121:"http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2011/9/14_Open_Data_up_for_adoption_files/014612-LineaAmica.jpg";s:6:"length";s:5:"25623";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:47:"

In this case the government should only publish hi-quality data in an open, machine-readable format and let the others do all the rest. <br/>Others are pointing to the risks of the so-called “data divide” or, from a public value perspective, think that government should consider different users needs and adopt a more pro-active approach e.g. by elaborating its data on governmental websites:<br/>	•	Interesting points on “data divide” or, more generally speaking, on “open data inclusion” for example are raised in <a href="http://gurstein.wordpress.com/2011/07/11/a-data-divide-data-%E2%80%9Chaves%E2%80%9D-and-%E2%80%9Chave-nots%E2%80%9D-and-open-government-data/">Michael Gurstein blog</a>. Moreover, in the comments of <a href="http://blogs.worldbank.org/developmenttalk/open-data-is-not-enough-0">this World Bank blog post</a>, <a href="http://www.timdavies.org.uk/">Tim Davies</a> highlights the importance of the skills to access, work with and interpret data widely amongst policy makers and local communities.<br/>	•	The public value perspective is introduced in this <a href="http://www.ctg.albany.edu/publications/journals/dgo2011_opengov/dgo2011_opengov.pdf">paper</a> from the <a href="http://www.ctg.albany.edu/">Center for Technology in Government (CTG)</a>, Albany, NY. Basically, this approach suggests that government should consider different users needs and the impact of a set of value generators on different groups of users.<br/><br/>So, what should public agencies do to ensure data inclusion and public value generation?<br/>I recently presented a paper at <a href="http://www.egov-conference.org/">EGOV 2011 conference</a> entitled <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/432233j6783626vk/">“Information strategies for Open Government in Europe: EU Regions opening up the data on Structural Funds”</a>.  In the paper I identified three groups of European Public Agencies publishing the data on the beneficiaries of EU Regional Policy:<br/>	1.	Agencies that publish the data in PDF with little information and detail on projects and financial data<br/>	2.	Agencies that focus on data quality, detail, accessibility and machine-readable formats<br/>	3.	Agencies that focus on data visualization, maps, graphs and interactive search, but only a few of them let the user download the underlying raw data<br/>It seems that the second group is following a good strategy from an “invisible hand” point of view, but is lacking actions to include non-technically oriented citizens.  The third, even if it can be argued that is not pursuing even an “open” data approach, shows some interest in data inclusion since it’s presenting the data in a “easier” way (maps, etc.) and/or in an aggregated form, which are useful for non-technically oriented citizens.<br/>One conclusion that can be drawn is that both the approaches are necessary.  But is it really necessary that every agencies develop their own data visualization tools? How many tools are necessary for the same kind of data (e.g. beneficiaries of EU funding) in EU regions?  What is the minimum set of information (metadata, notes from the public administration to suggest a correct interpretation, etc.) required for this kind of data?<br/>For example, in the case of <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/capexplained/index_en.htm">European Common Agricultural Policy</a>: should each State develop geo-referencing tools and maps or let <a href="http://farmsubsidy.org/">Farmsubsidy.org</a> do all the work?";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:176:"http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2011/9/7_A_strategic_balance_for_open_government_data_publication_files/Open%20data%20and%20the%20invisible%20hand.png";s:6:"length";s:5:"64035";s:4:"type";s:9:"image/png";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:47:"

Obama’s Directive, which directly (and almost immediately) influenced policy making in most OECD countries and also contributed to the growth of <a href="http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2010/11/4_Open_data_italy__the_bottom-up_approach.html">bottom-up initiatives</a>, is now impacting the world of research.<br/>Key questions such as the actual impact of open government data on citizens and enterprises remain largely unanswered.  It is not just a matter of democratic principles and political messages, or transparency only. The diffusion of web 2.0 technologies and user-driven innovations in the public sector – along with the creation of new business opportunities coming from the re-use of government data by the private sector – is changing the perspective of interdisciplinary but actually quite separated research fields such as e-government (focused on the use of ICT in internal processes and in public services provision) and e-democracy (focused on citizen engagement through technologies such as on line polling and voting, deliberation, consultation). <a href="http://www.albany.edu/communication/faculty-harrison.htm">Teresa M. Harrison</a> and her colleagues from the <a href="http://www.ctg.albany.edu/">Center for Technology in Government (CTG)</a> at the University of Albany SUNY made this clear in a <a href="http://www.ctg.albany.edu/publications/journals/dgo2011_opengov/dgo2011_opengov.pdf">paper</a> published a few days ago: “Although e-democracy in political and e-government in administrative realms have historically been largely separated, it now appears Open Government brings these two spheres of activity together”.  On the one hand, the provision of e-government services not only requires technical expertise but also, inevitably, implies political choices. On the other hand, e-government implementation should take advantage of the “power of the crowd” and the opportunities that come from involving the citizen and the private sector in new forms of public-private collaboration.<br/>As boundaries between research domains are blurring, time has come to define an Open Government holistic framework and a global Open Government R&amp;D agenda. <br/>In Europe, the <a href="http://www.crossroad-eu.net/">CROSSROAD</a> project, a Support Action funded by the European Commission, has produced a Research Roadmap for “ICT for governance and policy modeling”, as defined by the objective 7.3 of the EU Seventh Framework Programme (FP7) 2009-2010.  A <a href="http://crossroad.epu.ntua.gr/files/2010/02/CROSSROAD-State_of_the_Art_Analysis-White_Paper-v1.00.pdf">white paper</a> published in December 2010 and edited by <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/fenareti">Fenareti Lampathaki</a>, <a href="http://skous.gr/">Sotiris Koussouris</a>, <a href="http://t-government.blogspot.com/">Yannis Charalabidis</a> and <a href="http://www.ece.ntua.gr/index.php?option=com_dep&task=profile&id=87&Itemid=62&lang=en">Dimitris Askounis</a> (<a href="http://www.ntua.gr/">National Technical University of Athens</a>) identifies five main research themes and a three-level taxonomy. As the point of view is the broader concept of ICT for governance and policy making, a set of useful tools and research domains that are not usually considered in the current debate on Open Government are included here.  This is the case of public opinion mining tools, which could be used to find out, for example, what types of citizens care about which type of government information. Another examples are the technologies that the EU classifies into the “<a href="http://www.future-internet.eu/">Future Internet</a>” studies, some of which (e.g. the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_Services">Internet of Services</a>) are based on government linked data availability.<br/>In the US, the President’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology (PCAST) highlighted the importance of establishing an R&amp;D agenda for open government in a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/pcast-nitrd-report-2010.pdf">report</a> issued in December 2010. The <a href="http://nitrd.gov/opengov">Open Government Research &amp; Development Summit</a> was hosted on March 21-22nd, 2011 by the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development (NITRD) Program. The summit brought together government leaders and researchers to explore the needs of the community, and was organized by the office of the U.S. Chief Technology Officer <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/about/leadershipstaff/chopra">Aneesh Chopra</a>, while <a href="http://cairns.typepad.com/">Beth Noveck</a> - law professor at the New York Law School - was one of the prime movers on getting the meeting to happen. Building on this first event, a <a href="http://www.ctg.albany.edu/news/press_ogworkshop_20110427">workshop organized by the Center for Technology in Government (CTG)</a> in Albany, New York on April 27-28th gathered a number of academics, practitioners and, moreover, hundreds of research questions still unanswered. These questions were then clustered into omogeneous groups such as “the value / ecosystem of Open Government”, “What do citizens want?”, “Government capabilities”, etc.  As a second step, research questions were considered by four lenses: 1) law and policy, 2) management, 3) technology and 4) cross-cutting. <a href="http://inesmergel.wordpress.com/">Professor Ines Mergel</a> reported on this in her blog: <a href="http://inesmergel.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/open-government-research-and-development-agenda-setting-opengovrd-workshop/">day one</a> and <a href="http://inesmergel.wordpress.com/2011/04/29/open-pa-commons/">day two</a>. Furthermore, a full list of all the questions is now available in a <a href="http://www.ctg.albany.edu/publications/reports/OGWorkshop_ActivityReport/OGWorkshop_ActivityReport.pdf">CTG report</a> prepared by <a href="http://www.ctg.albany.edu/about/about?sub=people&section=meghan">Meghan Cook</a> and M. Alexander Jurkat, which also include an interesting list of the biggest challenges faced in Open Government as perceived by the participants. <br/><br/>EU CROSSROAD project and US CTG workshop came up with quite similar research themes and questions, with CTG themes mainly comprised in the first section of CROSSROAD taxonomy “Open government Information and Intelligence for transparency”. Other CROSSROAD areas partially in common with the US approach are, for example, “Social computing, citizen engagement and inclusion” and “Identity management and trust in governance”.<br/>In the following table I try to combine some of the most interesting aspects of the CROSSROAD and CTG exercises, that is a robust identification of research clusters and the use of “lens” corresponding to different disciplines.<br/>Questions and themes are grouped together on the basis of data and information flows from government to citizens and back from citizens and businesses to government. With reference to the figure:<br/>	1.	Open / linked data “supply side”: how to foster meaningful and useful government data publication? What implications / impact within the government agencies?<br/>	2.	Open / linked data “demand side”: how to meet citizen and businesses needs? How to support data use and re-use?<br/>	3.

In particular, in the case of Structural Funds, there is no single point of access to the data, since each single EU Region and National agency acting as Managing Authority of the Funds is responsible for publishing data on the beneficiaries and the amount of public funding received.  This implies that hundreds of Managing Authorities are following different paths and implementing different information strategies when opening up their data.  Many databases (often simple PDF lists) are now uploaded to regional or national institutional websites, showing huge variation not only in the way they can be accessed (formats, search masks, data visualization etc.) but also in content and quality of data provided (detail level, granularity, description, etc.).<br/>Last summer, after a <a href="http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2010/3/2_Open_data_and_structural_funds.html">first analysis on the prevailing formats</a>, I started to design an independent web-based survey on the overall quality of data published by each Managing Authority responsible for the 434 Operational Programmes approved in July 2009.  Data was collected in October 2010 by me and Chiara Assunta Ricci, a brilliant PhD student in Economics at La Sapienza University of Rome. We were inspired by what people at the fantastic project <a href="http://farmsubsidy.org/">Farmsubsidy.org</a> had been able to do with the data from the other big EU policy, the Common Agricultural Policy.   While their greatest achievement is having gathered the PDF documents every State has to publish on line in one real database, they also provide an evaluation of the lists of projects they have used by a <a href="http://farmsubsidy.org/transparency/">transparency composite indicator</a>.  The same exercise could be applied to Structural Funds.<br/>The first output of the survey was published a few days ago in the European Journal of ePractice. <a href="http://www.epractice.eu/en/document/5290093">Here</a> you can download the paper and <a href="http://www.epractice.eu/en/editorial/5290077">here</a> the full issue &quot;The Openness of Government&quot;.  The paper is based on <a href="http://www.epractice.eu/en/document/287915">David Osimo's seminal proposal for a “Benchmarking 2.0”</a> and represents a pilot of a measurement framework for comparing governments’ efforts to make data available.  <br/>This exercise could represent a first step for improving current ‘traditional’ EU e-Government benchmarking. In fact, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/item-detail-dae.cfm?item_id=6537">new edition “Digitizing Public Services in Europe: Putting ambition into action - 9th Benchmark Measurement</a>” (page 19 and 137) confirms the importance of updating and expanding the scope of the analysis by including new metrics on “Transparent and Open Government” .<br/>The evaluation scheme is based on the <a href="http://www.opengovdata.org/home/8principles">Eight principles of Open Government Data</a>, which are considered as a key reference and a worldwide de facto standard.  This scheme is meant to be flexible and could be applied to other kinds of Government Data.   <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/gianfrancoand">Gianfranco Andriola</a>, one of the promoters of the <a href="http://www.formez.it/iodl/">Italian Open Data Licence</a>, helped me define the methodological approach for the principles “format” and “licence”.  I must also thank the “man behind the curtain” of <a href="http://www.spaghettiopendata.org/">Spaghetti Open Data</a> initiative, <a href="http://www.dagoneye.it/">Matteo Brunati aka Dagoneye</a>, for his suggestions about open formats, and <a href="http://sergioscicchitano.wordpress.com/">Sergio Scicchitano</a> for his many advices and support.<br/>Results can be summarized as follows:<br/>	•	The European Cohesion Policy is only halfway to accomplishing a paradigm shift to open data, with differences in performance both between and – in some cases - within European countries. Best performing countries such as the Czech Republic and Finland obtain a score of 71%, while the worst performing Member State is Latvia with 25%. Countries from the eastern Europe often appear in the first half of the chart. <br/>	•	Very low scores are attributed to the formats the authorities are choosing when publishing their data on the web, while other indicators such as the level of granularity are positively influenced by the requirements of current regulations.  <br/>	•	A considerable difference in performance is shown when comparing datasets that are shared and centralized at national level with those which are managed by a single regional authority.  This variation is also statistically significant with regard to all the indicators examined, and is probably due to the fact that a centrally managed programme has the advantage that information flows are easier to manage and local actions are more easily coordinated.<br/>	•	The use of open, machine-processable and linked-data formats have unexpected advantages in terms of transparency and re-use of the data by the public and private sector. The application of these technical principles does not need extra budget or major changes in government organization and information management; nor does it require the update of existing software and infrastructures. What is needed today is the promotion among national and local authorities of the culture of transparency and the raising of awareness of the benefits that could derive from opening up existing data and information in a re-usable way.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:209:"http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2011/3/18_Towards_EU_Benchmarking_2.0_-_Transparency_and_Open_Data_on_Structural_Funds_in_Europe_files/logo%20epractice%20the%20openness%20of%20gov.jpg";s:6:"length";s:5:"20535";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:47:"

These are some of the conclusions I came to:<br/>	•	financial resources dedicated to e-government and information society in Southern Italy are huge compared to its actual absorptive capacity; <br/>	•	from a “governance” point of view, after a political phase dominated by a well-publicized “shared vision”, low investment from the national government increased the role of regional policies in the whole implementation of e-government in Italy. This caused, especially in the South, a stronger role of Regional Cohesion Policy in defining strategies and policy priorities.<br/>	•	Since national government - for many reasons - can no longer play the role of coordination center of local actions, interregional coordination and collaboration is becoming essential. The DPS project I wrote about <a href="Entries/2010/8/7_Co-designing_regional_innovation_policies__a_new_project_for_multi-level,_bottom-up_coordination.html">in the past</a> is one possible and still experimental solution.<br/>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:111:"http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2010/12/27_Regional_Strategies_files/droppedImage.png";s:6:"length";s:5:"55002";s:4:"type";s:9:"image/png";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:47:"

It is no exaggeration to claim that, for many countries, the entire Lisbon Agenda rests on Structural Funds”.<br/>This is particularly true for the lagging regions of the “Convergence” objective, where structural funds are by far the main source of funding for innovation in general and for e-services in particular. A specific “category of expenditure” is in fact dedicated to public e-services such as e-health, e-government, e-learning, e-inclusion, etc. which are named “services and application for the citizen” (Regulation no. 1828/2006).<br/>Using European Commission data on programmed resources for the 2007-13 period, it is possible to explore the amount of total resources dedicated to this topic by each single Operational Programme (OP).   The map above shows the amount of resources programmed by all types of OPs (regional, but also national and interregional), with regional disaggregation (NUTS2). Regions from Slovack Republic have planned high investments in e-services (more than 189 million euros); Campania (147,5 million euros), Andalucia (Spain) and Attiki (Greece) also belong to the cluster of Regions showing the highest absolute values.<br/>Moreover, considering the percentage of the resources not only for e-services but also for the other categories of expenditure dedicated to Information Society, it is possible to analyze the strategy each region implemented when allocating public funds to public e-services, broadband, ICT diffusion among enterprises or infrastructural services. In the “Convergence” Regions, a specific “public e-services strategy” emerges.  That means that Regions investing in public e-services tend to exclude the other matters; they concentrate available resources to e-government or e-health, and very low percentage of total funding is dedicated to the other categories such as broadband or infrastructural services.  For example, while funds dedicated to ICT diffusion among enterprises are always accompanied by measures for broadband penetration, resources for e-services “stand alone”, and show low correlation with the other components of Information Society funding.  This fact, if confirmed, seems not really positive, since the development of e-services should come along with the diffusion of the necessary pre-conditions.<br/>Another interesting question is: what determine this strategic choice? is it possible to isolate context-specific factors or the choice is based only on political criteria? <br/>Preliminary results of this study are included in the presentation embedded below, which <a href="http://sergioscicchitano.wordpress.com/">Sergio Scicchitano</a> and I have prepared for the first public meeting of <a href="http://www.econ.uniurb.it/eib_project/">Technology Adoption and Innovation in Public Services (TAIPS) research project</a> at University of Urbino, Italy.

Some people believe that no one even plans to create it, though Mr. Renato Brunetta, Italian Minister for Innovation and Public Administration, in an interview with Wired Italy in June, promised that a “Data.gov.it” will be launched by the end of 2010 following the example of <a href="http://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a>.<br/>Evidently, Italian “civic hackers” did not believe him or simply could not wait. So yesterday they launched their own open data public portal with a tiny budget and lots of enthusiasm. Well, to be precise, not one but two different open government portals appeared on the web on exactly the same day.<br/>The first, <a href="http://www.datagov.it/">datagov.it</a>, is promoted by the brand new Italian Association for Open Government, a small group mainly composed of independent consultants working for national agencies or institutions such as Formez (a public agency for training courses dedicated to central public administrations) or ForumPA (a leading company in organizing major events and exhibits for public administrations), or connected to the network InnovatoriPA (Italian Innovators in the Public Administration). Their main objective is to publish a manifesto for open government in Italy, the draft of which is now available for public consultation and will be finally released on November 30, 2010.  The manifesto seems not to be linked to any particular action or event, as it was the <a href="http://eups20.wordpress.com/the-open-declaration/">Open Declaration on European Public Services</a>, which was conceived to influence the <a href="http://eups20.wordpress.com/about/www.megovconf-lisbon.gov.pt/images/stories/ministerial_declaration_final_version_180907.pdf">Ministerial Declaration on e-government</a>.  This website also has <a href="http://www.datagov.it/data-sets-italiani/">a page</a> containing a list of publicly available datasets - very small for now (only 8 listed), but growing.<br/>The second website is ironically entitled “<a href="http://www.spaghettiopendata.org/index-en.html">Spaghetti Open Data</a>”.  Rather than a declaration or a manifesto, the portal focuses on the available datasets by listing and classify them in a rigorous way. The group of volunteers behind this effort is composed of key civil servants and information holders in Italian Regional and National Government which were supported by a team of very efficient developers.<br/>This is how Alberto Cottica, one of the promoters, commented on yesterday’s launch on <a href="http://www.cottica.net/2010/11/03/spaghetti-open-data-una-piccola-cosa-che-mi-fa-stare-benea-little-thing-that-feels-right/">his blog</a>:<br/>“We aggregated 32 databases; not bad when you consider that <a href="http://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a>, with all the firepower of the Obama administration, had 47 at launch.<br/>It’s only a small thing, but it feels right for various reasons.<br/>Firstly, it is a concrete achievement. I have had enough of complaining about the idle government, the backwardness of Italian culture, the financial crisis, bad luck. I have precious little time to spare, and I would like to invest it on projects that pay me back by yielding some kind of result. The Spaghetti Open Data group has put in some work, and in a few weeks it produced something which is actually there, and it works. If you want to build something with Italian open data you can, right now, without having to wait for structural change or a new generation in government. All it took is some voluntary work and 41 euro for hosting.<br/>Secondly, it is intellectually rigorous. We had to ask ourselves the same questions that I imagine confronted the people in charge of <a href="http://www.data.gov/">data.gov</a> and <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a>. Are statistic data open data? (Apparently not) Does it make sense for statistical and open data to be collected in the same place? (Apparently it does, so that citizens can correlate the ones with the others) How to organize metadata? (We went for compatibility with <a href="http://ckan.net/about">CKAN</a>, as in data.gov.uk) we have mapped a possible way for Italian open data, and future legitimate websites of open data have an all-Italian benchmark that they can consider, or even copy.<br/>Finally, it is the expression of a small community of about fifty bloggers and civil servants that worked together towards a common goal, across their considerable cultural differences, showing mutual respect along the way. I have also had enough of bashing bureaucrats as stupid or evil. Some are just that, others are wonderful people and great war buddies. Most are reasonably clever, well-meaning people who happen to be very different from me: collaborating requires investing a little time and effort to come to understand each other. It is almost always worth it”<br/><br/>That said, while the national open data portal is somehow being created, as always happens the best things are happening at regional level. Same thing with open data: good efforts to open up public data and to create open data portals are from the Regional Authorities.

As a student, I studied microeconomics from his famous manual which is used in almost every University in the world. Recently, I used Microeconomic Analysis again in my own Economics course at La Sapienza University in Rome, and I rediscovered the clarity and rigor of this text. But my life literally changed after reading Information Rules, a groundbreaking book he wrote with Carl Shapiro in 1999. This book led me to study innovation and technology and to make the study of innovation a profession.  <br/>Many of you might know he is now Chief Economist at Google, and his job is analyzing economic trends by exploiting the potential of Google Trends and the tons of queries people make every day. A very exiting job indeed. He is certainly the master of web 2.0 data.<br/>Professor Varian is now touring Europe for a series of meetings that will culminate with the WTO Forum in Geneva tomorrow. Last Thursday he was over in Rome to meet the Italian Minister of Labour Maurizio Sacconi at a <a href="http://www.lavoro.gov.it/Lavoro/Appuntamenti/20100908_WebEconomy.htm">public meeting</a> organized by the lobbying and media company <a href="http://www.retionline.it/index.html">Reti</a> entitled “Web Economy: Internet for economic development”.   How could I have passed up the opportunity of being there and asking him a couple of questions about open data and gov 2.0?<br/><br/>Professor Varian, what do you think about this kind of global fever for open data and Gov 2.0? Is it all hype or does have a future?<br/>I think that this model is very attractive. You can think of the government as the wholesaler of data, that puts it up in bulk form. Then this data can be downloaded, refined and improved for retail and distribution. There are a lot of reasons to think that that model might be attractive, because the role that the Government would play would be quite specifically defined: make the raw data available. Then people can extract from that what they want, and polish it, beautify it, crack it and a lot of other things. So that is a model which I think could be attractive to Italy, the US and the other Countries. The problem of managing the data from end to end is that it’s very expensive and a very big challenge. The most important step is to make the data available even if it’s in a raw and unfinished form.<br/>Two days ago, at Gov 2.0 Summit 2010 in Washington DC Ellen Miller of Sunlight Foundation strongly criticized the availability and quality of the data published on USAspending.gov and Data.gov. It seems that this revolution is actually not happening yet.<br/>Well, I think that in the Obama administration, for example, they are making a lot of more patent data available, FCC (Federal Communications Commission) data available, and so on. So it is happening, it’s just not as rapid as one might think, because it’s a difficult problem. But I think there’s enough momentum behind this effort, and we will see progress. As they say &quot;pazienza&quot;! (he laughs).";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:136:"http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2010/9/14_A_chat_with_HAL_VARIAN_on_Open_Data_and_Gov_2.0_files/Hal_Varian.jpg";s:6:"length";s:5:"68990";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:47:"

Member states and EU Regions are responsible for publishing data on the beneficiaries of the policy and the corresponding amount of public funding received.  <br/>Although the set of minimum information that the European Commission and Member States agreed on in the COCOF of 23rd April 2008 is still relatively small (it only includes the name of the beneficiary, the project and the amount of public funding), the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/eti/index_en.htm">European Transparency Initiative</a> of the European Commission certainly represents a breakthrough innovation in the way most European Countries implement public policy. In the last few years the policy framework and strict regulation of Structural Funds have played a crucial role in pushing the transparency agenda in those areas of Europe where administrative culture and capacity is traditionally low.<br/>A study on current availability of open data on Structural Funds was presented at the European Parliament during the public hearing <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/cont/oj/822/822828/822828en.pdf">Transparency in Structural Funds - recipients and beneficiaries</a> held by the President of the <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/activities/committees/homeCom.do?language=EN&body=CONT">Budget Control Committee</a>, <a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/members/expert/committees/view.do?language=EN&id=97129">Luigi de Magistris</a> (one of the aims of the hearing was to learn from the US website <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/Pages/home.aspx">Recovery.gov</a>, which was presented by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Devaney">Earl E. Devaney</a>, Chairman of the US government’s <a href="http://www.recovery.gov/About/board/Pages/TheBoard.aspx">Recovery Accountability and Transparency Board</a>).<br/>The report, entitled “The Data Transparency Initiative and its Impact on Cohesion Policy” (<a href="http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/cont/dv/data_transparency_/data_transparency_en.pdf">full report</a>), evaluates the implementation of the European Transparency Initiative by providing some data and four case studies: Finland, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland.  The study was carried out by the Centre for Industrial Studies (CSIL) in Milan, Italy and financed by the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Development. <br/>As stated in the blog <a href="http://blog.transparency.org/2010/07/13/towards-a-new-and-more-transparent-culture-of-spending-eu-funds/">Space for Transparency</a>, the situation reported in the study “results in incomparable, often not machine readable and in some countries almost unusable data in different EU languages and different currencies”. <br/>The results of the study are indeed not so encouraging. Only 78% of the European Regions managing an ERDF Operational Programme provide the minimum information required.  19% provide a description of the operations, 41% a location of the projects, 27% the amount of national co-funding. Moreover, while 44% of EU Regions publish data on the total amount of funding, only 32% of available datasets specify the amount of public money actually paid out.  PDF is confirmed as the prevailing format in which data are released (52%), followed by XLS (27%) and HTML (21%); a situation that did not change one year later (March 2010). See the table I included in my post <a href="Entries/2010/3/2_Open_data_and_structural_funds.html">Open data and structural funds</a>.<br/>As expected, these different approaches seem to reflect differences both in administrative capacities and cultural administrative traditions.  In addition, the report argues that centralization vs. decentralization issues play also a role. Obviously, a centrally managed Programme has the advantage that information flows are easier to manage and local actions are more easily coordinated.<br/>The report draws some final recommendations:<br/>	•	to provide additional essential information, such as contact details, localization, project summaries, description of project partners, etc.<br/>	•	to make databases fully searchable and compatible, so as to make possible an EU-wide outlook of the data<br/>	•	to describe the data in English and not only in the local language<br/><br/>Some personal remarks:<br/>	1)	The study is the first attempt to evaluate the availability and quality of open data on Structural Funds provided by a diverse and complex set of National and Regional Authorities. The statistics provided are a useful starting point for any further research in the field. Moreover, the report provides a valuable contextualization and interpretation of results, along with a detailed description of the European Transparency Initiative.<br/>	2)	The analysis dates back to March 2009 and should be updated. Since then the number of EU Regions providing at least a minimum set of information has grown and have now reached 100%, as reported in <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/country/commu/beneficiaries/index_en.htm">the map of InfoRegio website</a>; though I guess the indicators on quality have not significantly improved.<br/>	3)	The survey, which seems to be conducted starting from the links that were available on the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/country/commu/beneficiaries/index_en.htm">InfoRegio map</a> at the time, does not consider other important types of Operational Programmes such as the National Programmes and Interregional Programmes or the cross-border co-operation Programmes.<br/>	4)	Data on quality of the open datasets are presented only in an aggregate way, so it is impossible to compare different nations or regions.";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:9:"enclosure";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:184:"http://www.luigireggi.eu/Innovation-policies/Home/Entries/2010/9/9_Open_data_On_Structural_Funds_at_the_european_parliament_-_the_long_way_towards_transparency_files/Senza%20titolo.jpg";s:6:"length";s:5:"50435";s:4:"type";s:10:"image/jpeg";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:47:"

While the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/esf/">European Social Fund (ESF)</a> is dedicated to the development of human capital, the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/funds/feder/index_en.htm">European Regional Development Fund</a> (ERDF), as stated in the European Regulation No 1080/2006, contributes towards the financing of productive investment and infrastructures as well as the development of endogenous potential through measures which support regional and local development. <br/>Each EU region inserts its policy objectives in its regional <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/atlas2007/index_en.htm">Operational Programmes</a> or in a shared National or Interregional Programme. For each regional objective, the selection criteria of projects are set out by a dedicated Managing Authority. <br/>In the case of Italy, with their ERFD regional Operational Programmes (OPs)<br/>	-	all regions have programmed funding for research projects carried out by enterprises (in collaboration with research centres or other enterprises) and for innovation in enterprises; 13 OPs include actions for the creation of new businesses in the emerging sectors<br/>	-	19 regions intend to empower research infrastructures, equipment and instrumentation to support R&amp;I supply, and to create clusters and structures for technological transfer (innovation poles, technological districts, competence centres)<br/>The total amount of resources dedicated to Research, Innovation and Information Society by all Italian Operative Programmes 2007-2013 exceeds 20.7 billion Euros.  70% of these resources are concentrated in only 5 Regions of the South: Campania, Puglia, Sicilia, Calabria and Basilicata.  This is the highest amount of money ever managed by those regional authorities for this particularly difficult kind of policy.<br/><br/>A specific action for inter-regional coordination in Italy<br/>In 2008, the <a href="http://www.dps.mef.gov.it/">Department for Development and Cohesion Policies (DPS)</a> of the Italian Ministry of Economic Development - responsible for Structural Funds in Italy - launched a technical assistance project dedicated to the Italian Regions of the Convergence objective (the five regions mentioned above) and aimed at sharing good practices of policy implementation in the field of Research and Innovation. In particular, academic support was offered to tackle critical issues, such as empowering strategic design capability and project selections, in itinere and ex post evaluation, the efficient use of conditionality and result-driven funding.   Eight working groups were created, involving more than 100 representatives of regional administrations plus the central ministries and agencies responsible for national innovation policies.  I dedicated a <a href="perma://BLPageReference/A9A433BC-1B47-4A4A-BA77-189C86835FE0">post</a> to some of the high-level conclusions the final report of the first phase of the project (2008-09), in which you can also find not only regional data on structural funds in Italy, but also methodological advice and examples of good practices.<br/>A new phase of the project has just been launched: “Sostegno alle politiche di ricerca e innovazione delle Regioni” (“Support to regional Research and Innovation policies”). The new wave is promising more in-depth analysis of current trends of regional policy for Research and Innovation. Moreover, central and local policy-makers are actively involved in order to co-design policies, to share implementation practices and to draft policy documents and templates ready to be used in day-to-day activities. It’s up to a few thematic working groups to produce drafts of grants, strategies, evaluation studies, implementation processes, etc. in true ‘Gov 2.0’ style, e.g. through the use of tools for on line collaboration.<br/>To date, four working groups, coordinated by high level experts and practitioners, have been focusing on at least six policy issues:<br/>	1.	Technological foresight and regional policy<br/>	2.	Selection and criteria for research projects<br/>	3.	Conditionality and funding of projects<br/>	4.	Pre-commercial Public procurement<br/>	5.	In itinere evaluation indicators<br/>	6.	Ex post evaluation indicators<br/>You can download the powerpoint presentations of the project on the <a href="http://www.aginnovazione.gov.it/it/news_comunicazioni/agenda/news_0002.html">website of the National Agency for Innovation</a> (Agenzia per la diffusione delle tecnologie per l’Innovazione), in Italian.<br/><br/>Innovation policy needs multi-level coordination<br/>But the scope of these activities could not be limited to national boundaries. The ‘secret agenda’ of Andrea Bonaccorsi, professor of Economics at the University of Pisa and coordinator of the project, is to connect Italian regional authorities to the European regional network, and import innovative ideas from the most advanced EU regions.<br/>The rationale is clear. From a regional point of view, it is useless and dangerous to let national or EU plans identify long-term regional policy goals and research priorities by simply ‘copying’ the most fashionable EU or national ideas into local strategies and plans. For example, it is evident that focusing on biotechnology, ICT or nanotechnology may not be the best strategy for all European regions; but this seems to be the case if you take a look at regional policy documents. Instead, Prof Bonaccorsi suggests to apply the ‘smart specialization’ approach to regional priority setting. The effort should be concentrated on specific sectors and niches of application by combining General Purpose Technologies such as ICT with locally generated competencies.  In other words, regions must find their true vocation, and the experience of other advanced European territories might prove fundamental. The increasing interest toward territory-based innovation policies is demonstrated by the growing regional percentage of public expenditure for Research and Innovation in most OECD countries, especially in those countries where regional governments have greater autonomy (see figure above).<br/>The <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/invest-in-research/pdf/download_en/kfg_policy_brief_no9.pdf?11111">concept of smart specialization</a> was first introduced by Dominique Foray, Paul A. David and Bronwyn Hall - experts of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/invest-in-research/monitoring/knowledge_en.htm">Knowledge for Growth group (K4G)</a> working for the President of the European Commission - and then embedded in <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eu2020/index_en.htm">Europe 2020</a> strategy. Regional specialization implies a multi-level governance to coordinate different, place-based policies at national and regional level. An on-going research project by the OECD and the European Commission identifies some of the main barriers to a seamless policy-making process at national level: <br/>	-	low political and technical capabilities of local institutions, <br/>	-	duplication of competencies and plans and <br/>	-	the presence of policy gaps (policy areas not covered).<br/><br/>Towards a bottom-up approach to policy coordination<br/>Now, how to realize multi-level coordination? While multi-level governance can be improved trough political agreements or the creation of dedicated agencies, the value of this kind of projects is to provide good examples of a bottom-up approach. People involved in policy implementation from different regions - along with national technical bodies - are given the chance to meet their peers and share knowledge, as happens in a true community of practice.
